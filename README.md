## Project Status

**This in Beta status. Use in production at your own caution.**

We are currently focusing on porting [graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) to Python.
This library includes core features only that other packages within the [graphql-python](https://github.com/graphql-python/) organization shall build upon.
We are currently targeting feature parity with `v0.4.7` of the reference implementation.

Please see [issues](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core/issues) for the progress.

## Getting Started

An overview of the GraphQL language is available in the 
[README](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/blob/master/README.md) for the
[Specification for GraphQL](https://github.com/facebook/graphql). 
The overview describes a simple set of GraphQL examples that exist as [tests](tests/core_starwars)
in this repository. A good way to get started is to walk through that README and the corresponding tests
in parallel. 

### Using `graphql-core`

Install from pip:

```sh
pip install graphql-core
```
