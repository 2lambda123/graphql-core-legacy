## Project Status

**This project is highly experimental. Please do not use this in production yet.**

I'm currently focusing on porting [graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) to Python. First release (0.1) will include core features only.

Please see [issues](https://github.com/dittos/graphql-py/issues) for the progress.
